## Introducing the Geo Calc Toolkit API

**Geo Calc Toolkit** provides APIs for calculating **distance, length, and area** of various geospatial objects.

These APIs can be applied to a wide range of business and technical scenarios involving geospatial data, such as
**location-based services (LBS), map visualization, route analysis, and geofencing**.
